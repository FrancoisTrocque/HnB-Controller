# HnB-Controller
Hope &amp; Bike projet Fablab CAEN FRANCE

This project contains the source code of the 2 processors used in the Hope & Bike controller board

The Board controls a Bike Hub motor of 250W
It comunicates with the Brain of the system (an Arduino board) by the means of the BioNet network

Bionet stands for Bike Open Network

This simple network as been developted for the Hope & Bike projet
Base on a producer / consumer model and on master salve topology it manages information dedicated to the bike
Power in motor
Current in Motor
Battery voltage
.....
